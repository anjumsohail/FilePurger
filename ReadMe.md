# 🗑️ FilePurger

**FilePurger** is a safe file purging utility for Windows that scans all drives (or a specific path) for files in selected categories (documents, images, videos, etc.) and moves old files to a quarantine folder instead of deleting them immediately.  
It maintains **two separate logs**:
1. **Scan Log** – All files scanned, skipped, or moved.
2. **Move Log** – Only files that were moved to quarantine.
**Who Need this** Corporates, Cyber Cafes or Educational Institutes that Need to Remove the User Data on Routine Basis for Data Security or Prevent Data breach without Factory Reset or System Format.

## 📜 Features

## 🛠️ Build Standalone Executable

If you want to make FilePurger.exe so it can run without Python:

1️⃣ Install Python (Official Version)

Uninstall Microsoft Store Python if installed.

Download from python.org – Python 3.12 (64-bit).

During install:

✅ Add Python to PATH

✅ Install pip

2️⃣ Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller psutil

3️⃣ Build EXE
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --name FilePurger safe_purge.py


The EXE will appear in the dist folder.

4️⃣ Install to C:\FilePurger

Create folder:

mkdir C:\FilePurger


Copy FilePurger.exe there.

Create C:\FilePurger\Logs and C:\FilePurger\Quarantine.

## 💼 Use Cases

Corporate environments to archive old files from shared drives.

Personal file cleanup while keeping a recovery option.

Compliance with data retention policies.

Preparing drives for reallocation without permanent deletion.

## Scheduled Task
Add the FilePurger.exe into the Windows Scheduled Tasks Or Modify the Included FilePurger_ScheduledTask.xml File and Import
Open Task Scheduler (taskschd.msc).
On the right panel, click Import Task….
Select your .xml file.
In the General tab, change the User to your own account (click Change User or Group).
Adjust StartBoundary date/time in the XML or inside Task Scheduler if you want a different run time.
Click OK — it will ask for your Windows password (so it can run even when you’re logged off).
and press Enter.

## ⚠️ Safety Notes

FilePurger never deletes files directly — they are moved to quarantine.

Review quarantine contents before manual deletion.

Run with administrative rights to ensure all drives are scanned.
