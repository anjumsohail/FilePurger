# üóëÔ∏è FilePurger

**FilePurger** is a safe file purging utility for Windows that scans all drives (or a specific path) for files in selected categories (documents, images, videos, etc.) and moves old files to a quarantine folder instead of deleting them immediately.  
It maintains **two separate logs**:
1. **Scan Log** ‚Äì All files scanned, skipped, or moved.
2. **Move Log** ‚Äì Only files that were moved to quarantine.
**Who Need this** Corporates, Cyber Cafes or Educational Institutes that Need to Remove the User Data on Routine Basis for Data Security or Prevent Data breach without Factory Reset or System Format.
